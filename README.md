# Custom STM32F4 Board
## I want to make my own custom board. The idea is to work with various peripherals and a special interest in trying out the CMSIS DSP library.
### TODO
 - [x] Find suitable serial flash.
 - [ ] Find MEMS sensors
 	- [ ] Gyro and accelerometer
 	- [ ] Microphone
 	- [ ] Pressure sensor
 - [ ] ........

### Some goals
- [ ] CMSIS FFT on microphone and accelerometer.
- [ ] FIR and IIR filter implementation.
- [ ] Standard timer stuff for RGB led.
- [ ] USB power + 12VDC as main supply
- [ ] SWD programming.
- [ ] Custom bootloader.
- [ ] DMA and ADC
- [ ] ........
